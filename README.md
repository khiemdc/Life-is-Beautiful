# Life-is-Beautiful
A team project with Aaron, Kevin & Khiem at GW bootcamp

Life is Beautiful App will provide an advantage by giving specifics of your move. Some of the most important factors in your decision will be Cost of Living, employment statistics, population demographics in the area youâ€™re aiming to move to, employment statisitics, and so forth. Many other factors hinge on these for example, an area with a high population of middle-class families is likely to have access to good schools, while a town with a university is likely to offer some cultural stimulation.
